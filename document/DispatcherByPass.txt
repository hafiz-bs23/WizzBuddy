You may sometime need to by pass the dispatcher. Say you deployed the JavaScript changes but the change is not reflecting in Publisher.
Dispatcher may have cached the old JavaScript. So we can bypass the dispatcher and check if publisher have the updated javascript. Another scenario is sometimes
after publication of a page or content change, some publish shows correct output and others don't. So if we want to directly hit a specific publisher, we need to bypass the dispatcher.

For bypassing the dispatcher the following context should be followed:

publisherName/ContentPath

For example for Dev environment: https://publish.dev.abbvie.adobecqms.net/content/abbvie-pro/de/de.html

Bellow are the publisher for specific environments:

    2. https://publish2.stage.abbvie.adobecqms.net
    3. https://publish3.stage.abbvie.adobecqms.net
