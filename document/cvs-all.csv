"I have 4+ years of experience in software development and had worked with several technologies such as GoLang, NodeJS, SQL, NoSQL, Angular, Ionic. I am very expert in Git, wrote API documentation with Swagger and Postman, also have some basics in DevOps. In recent days I feel very interested to learn DevOps, so studying. My thoughts about software technology are when a problem comes, before solving it I always try to understand why it is a problem. It makes more sense to me to think about how to solve it. I mostly give time to thinking and sketching the solution of a problem than coding. I give importance to creating highly readable and easily maintainable source code. Strong eye for detail and tenacity to never quit on something until it is absolutely perfect.
