Branches

1. Master -  is synced with the production.
2. Stage - is synced with the stage/qa
3. Dev - is synced with the dev

Process we follow when we start a new spring

1. Create new package.json/pom.xml version (with SNAPSHOT) in the master branch
2. Merge master to dev and stage
3. Create branch from master with name feature/hcp-xxx yyy or fix/hcp-xxx yyy for development and bug fix (ie. hcp-xxx/aic-xxx is the ticket number)
4. Once development is done, Create pull request to merge the branch to dev
5. Once dev is signed off, Create pull request to merge the branch to stage (which are planned to go live)
6. Once stage is signed off, Create pull request to merge stage to master.
7. After final approval update the package.json/pom.xml version (remove SNAPSHOT)
8. Create tag with the current release version
9. Ready for final production release

Process for Version update:
1. Use versions:set from the versions-maven plugin: ```mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=2.50.1-SNAPSHOT```
2. If you made a mistake, do ```mvn versions:revert```
3. afterwards ```mvn versions:commit```


Note: Never ever merge Dev branch or Stage branch to your feature branch. Always write Unit Test for your java code change. Resolve conflict smartly.
